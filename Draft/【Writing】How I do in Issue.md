Issue 题目：

> “A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.”  
>   
> Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.

# 1. 千万不要忽略 instruction

读完题目后一定要看清楚要求 [^1]

GRE 的 Issue instructions 有 5 种 [^2]：

## 同意程度 - 理由 - 探讨好坏 - 解释立场

这种就是一开始提到的 Issue 题目所使用的例子：

> Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, describe specific circumstances in which adopting the recommendation would or would not be advantageous and explain how these examples shape your position.

该 instruction 的要求为：
1. 说明你的立场：讨论下同意或者不同意的程度（最好不要太绝对）
2. 解释你所采取立场的理由
	1. 分析该建议是否有利的情况（正面和反面）
	2. 解释这些情况如何塑造你的立场

## 同意程度 - 理由 - 讨论可行/不可行的情况 - 解释立场

> Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.  

该 instruction 的要求为：
1. 说明你的立场：讨论下同意或者不同意的程度（最好不要太绝对）
2. 解释你所采取立场的理由
	1. 分析该陈述可能成立或不成立的情况
	2. 解释这些情况如何塑造你的立场

该 instruction 的要求为：
1. 讨论哪种观点更符合自己的立场
2. 解释该立场的理由 
	1. 考虑文中的两种观点的情况

---

# 2. 选择合适的论证结构
从以上这 5 种 instructions 可以看出 ETS 其实是希望我们两面写的。

1. 两面兼顾，本身即是看到了问题的复杂性 (complexities) 这是 ETS 乐意看到的思路。

2. 两面写，左右逢源，文章容易展开、容易写长这解决多数同学的字数难题。这是个很实际的好处。

3. 两面写的文章结构极好控制，若再配合得当的论证方法行文思路清晰、结构一目了然。常用的“两面写”的行文结构有下列三种，即：
	1. 正、反、合（即：支持、反对、然后再将前面正反两方面的分析综合阐述）
	2. 正、反、反（即：支持、反对、再反对）
	3. 正、反、散（即：支持、反对、然后从一个更深、更广的角度将问题的阐述加以散发）
4. 文章紧紧围绕着题目展开，思路集中，不易跑题对于这一点

1. 倾向于支持：

> 首段：表达立场  
> 主体段 1：支持的理由 1+ 对应论证  
> 主体段 2：支持的理由 2+ 对应论证  
> 主体段 3：需要额外考虑的情况，对立场进行 qualify，讨论某些情况下所支持的观点可能不利。
> 末段：总结

2. 倾向于反对：

> 首段：表达立场  
> 主体段 1：让步，指出题目论点的合理之处（一定要附上限定条件加以说明）
> 主体段 2：反对的理由 1+ 对应论证  
> 主体段 3：反对的理由 2+ 对应论证  
> 末段：总结  

3. 笼统观点，分情况讨论：

> 首段：表达立场（必须基于可靠的广泛接受的分类标准基础上）
> 主体段 1：情况 1，同意 or 反对 or 看情况  
> 主体段 2：情况 2，同意 or 反对 or 看情况  
> 主体段 3：情况 3，同意 or 反对 or 看情况  
> 末段：总结

# 3. 选择合适的开头结尾
## 开头

以下内容 [^3] 摘录自 [GRE写作ISSUE作文开头结尾经典模板分享 - 小站GRE](http://gre.zhan.com/tifen/26087.html)

第一种：直接陈述观点 + 概述理由
I agree with the speaker's broad assertion that money spent on research is generally well invested. However, the speaker unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to embrace research whose results are "controversial," while ignoring certain compelling reasons why some types of research might be unjustifiable. My points of contention with the speaker involve the fundamental objectives and nature of research, as discussed below.

例文中先支持原文观点：把钱话在研究上是很好的投资; 然后转折：结果有争议的研究可以不包含在投资范围的; 最后，引出下文要论述的理由。

第二种：比较双方观点，阐明自己观点

There is much debate over the universal issues whether or not tradition and modernization are incompatible. Some people may claim that they necessarily conflict with each other, while others argue that the two are not mutually exclusive. Insofar as I can think, the best way is to coordinate them and exert their own advantages for contemporary society.
第一句改写题目，第二句比较两种立场，第三句提出自己的观点。这种开头比较简单易学，也是同学们比较常用的开头方式，需要注意的是在点明自己的观点的时候，最好把下文中要进行分层论证的关键词结合到句子里面，比如上述例子中的 coordinate ;exert their own advantages，可以起到引领下文，令文章结构严谨的作用

第三种：背景开头 + 立场

Explosive development of science and technology has been made during the past one hundred years or so. When it comes to progress of the condition of humanity all over the world, there are always a host of different opinions held by different individuals from different areas. Have, you may wonder, the technology developments or innovations contributed to promoting our humanity? Admittedly, most people would consider that there are still so many troubles with us such as poverty, violence, conflicts and even wars. However, as a whole effect in general, technology progress has in fact, tend to lead to a significant promotion of the overall condition of humanity in the world.

第一步，先做背景引入，第二步提出自己的立场。这种开头方式的优点呢，是可以体现写作者的知识储备和语言水平，但是缺点是不如上述的两种方法简单易学，在做与题目相关的背景展开的时候容易落入俗套。所以，同学们在练习的时候需要选择适合自己的方法。

第四种：提问 + 立场

What are the limits of our duty to save endangered species from extinction? The statement raises a variety of issues about morality, conscience, self-preservation, and economics. On balance, however, I fundamentally agree with the notion that humans need not make "extraordinary" efforts--at the expense of money and jobs--to ensure the preservation of any endangered species.

以问句的形式开头，然后表明自己立场的开头段可以体现出句式的变化，与传统的开头方式相比，比较有新意，想要尝试变化的同学可以多练习一下。

### 综合情况

#### 有明显的社会、科学、历史背景

比如题目是有关科技的：

> As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.

有明显的教育背景：

> Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the students’ field of study.

> Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers.

那么我们起手可以介绍背景开头，然后过渡到争论（可以引入两方对立的观点，也可以由一个题目改写的提问句引起），接着介绍自己的观点。

比如第一个题目：

Explosive development of science and technology has been made during the past one hundred years or so, these new technology and tools enable us to solve problems in terms of individual and society more quickly and efficiently. 
	第一句引入相关背景，然后过渡缩小到题目所介绍的背景

So the author maintains that, when the masses rely on technology to solve problem more often, the ability of humans to think themselves will absolutely deteriorate. 
	接着引入作者的观点，可以直接陈述句，也可以使用提问的形式

Insofar as I can think, this conclusion made by the author unfairly generalizes.
	由以上的内容再过渡到自己观点，注意衔接词的使用

My points of contention with the speaker involve the fundamental objectives and nature of technology, as discussed below.
	这里可选，用于概括自己后面的内容，同时限定自己的主题，使其不太跑题。

#### 没有明显的背景，题目过于抽象，哲学

这种题目一般都十分的短，内容太 sweeping:

> Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.

> The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.

> If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it are justifiable.

我们可以参照上一部分的内容，只不过将相关背景的引入删除。

比如对于第一个题目：
如果我们按照第一种方法引入可以简单介绍政府的职能：
Since the rule of government cover a wide range of purview of our society, from legislation to funding national scientific research. So here the author assets that governments are not expected to finance scientific research whose consequence are not clear.
	起手一个介绍主体，然后过渡到作者的观点。

如果考场上没有那么哆嗦介绍主题，可以直接一个疑问句起手

Can governments just fund scientific research whose consequences are promising? <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The statement raises a variety of issues about</mark> the rules of government and the fundamental objectives and benefits of scientific research. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In balance, however, I fundamentally disagree</mark> with the speaker's view which unfairly generalizes, ignoring certain compelling reasons why some types of research might be unjustifiable.
	第一句疑问句改写题目，然后接一句过渡句，同时穿插自己后面介绍到的内容比如 `the rule of government`, `objective and benefits of scientific research` 等。然后介绍自己的观点，这里注意衔接词。接着从句中继续穿插自己的下文要介绍的内容。

## 结尾

第一种：总结结论 + 总结理由的方法
To sum up, given the reasons mentioned above, we may safely come to the conclusion that…. not only because…, but also because…, but it depends on...

第二种：回顾题目立场 + 再次确认自己立场
In sum, I concede that….Nonetheless, to some extent…, the speaker's claim overrates/underrates the importance of sth…. In the final analysis, the optimal approach, in my view, is a balanced one that …
	这里的展开方式记得和自己文章结构相同，这里如果自己不是在开头让步，那么不需要一开始就写 `concede that`，而是后面再写。

While it may be to the advantage of a nation that all its students learn the same basic information, this can be accomplished without going to the lengths of having a national curriculum. By requiring that all students know a certain amount in basic areas of knowledge without specifying the details, a nation can achieve the same benefits of a national curriculum without unduly denying the freedom of teachers to teach as they see fit. A system of simple national standard is good enough. To go further and create a full-fledged national curriculum would gain nothing and impair the ability of teachers.

It is important to ensure that all students learn the fundamental of different subject areas. In order to graduate from high school, for example, all students should have a good understanding of algebra, math, basic science and history, as well as the official languages that the nation uses. These skills are essential which will benefit people in all kinds of different careers. Even if one never manipulate an equation after graduating from high school, the basic knowledge of math will surely give he/her a better understanding of world. Other fields such as English and history are even more indispensable, as they are mostly necessary to maintain an informed citizenry capable of making proper and important decisions that all citizens of a democracy are called upon to make. To achieve this, it is necessary to have national standards of educations. Most teachers are very capable of imparting knowledge on students, and most school boards are similarly well-intentioned. Nonetheless, without national standards, some students are bound to fall through the cracks, and some school boards, under pressure from groups of parents, may eliminate certain subject matter from schools, as has happened recently with the teaching of evolution in conservation areas of the US. In order to ensure that all students learn all that they need to know as functioning adults, some kind of national standards should be in place.

These national standards, however, need not go so far to constitute a single national curriculum. As no one knows a class of students better than its teachers, and no one else can shape a national curriculum that suitable for all the students in the nation. In fact, a national curriculum would necessarily mean a one-size-fits-all approach, and what is appropriate in one classroom may not be in another. Partly because this is a result of the intellectual levels of the students in question: some may be able to learn more about a particular subject than others. But it also a question of students' goals. The desire for specialization begins before college. A student who wants to become an auto mechanic should be able to take auto shop classes, classes which would not be of interest to a future lawyer or scientist. This notion may sound unacceptably elitist in today's climate in which a college education has become almost an automatic goal of education, but it does not need to be this way. Students with limited interest in higher education should be able to opt out, to follow another curriculum that is more likely to lead to happiness later in life. As a society, we should not discourage them, but rather ensure that there are enough high-paying jobs available for skilled laborers with high school diplomas.

Everyone needs certain basic knowledge in order to function in society today. To this extent, we need national standards of instruction for students. But we do not need to cram every student into the same classes and force them to learn what we think is best for them.

Can governments just finance scientific research whose outcomes are promising? The statement raises a variety of issues about the rules of governments and the fundamental objectives and benefits of scientific research. In balance, however, I fundamentally disagree with the speaker's view which miss the points entirely, ignoring certain compelling reasons why some types of scientific research might be unjustifiable.

First of all, I concede that the speaker is on the correct sophisticated side of this issue. admittedly, research is the exploration of the unknown for true answers to our today questions, and for lasting solutions to our enduring problems. Research is also the chief means by which we humans attempt to satisfy our insatiable appetite for knowledge, and our craving to understand ourselves and the world. Yet, in the very notion of research also lies my first point of contention with the speaker, who illogically presumes that can know the results of the ongoing research before we investigate it. On the contrary, if research is to be of any value it must explore uncharted and unpredictable territory. In fact, any research whose benefits and consequences are immediately predictable should not be considered as 'research' at all.

Apart from that, when we invest in research irrespective of whether the outcomes might be controversial at the moment, we should also be circumspect about research whose objective are too vague and whose potential benefits are too speculative. After all, any research carrying potential significant social benefits also demands expensive costs. Nonetheless, to any extent we cannot just shut down scientific research due to its unpromising results to save money. On the one hand, taxpayers in the nation give their money to the governments to support social infrastructure, which involving the investigation on scientific research, and this part of finance does not expect immediate or predictable benefits, for the fact that research is a exploration which no one knows the results. So governments are not supposed to cut down finance support on research with unpromising results. On the other hand, the results of research usually takes years of evaluation and verification to secure the answer whether this results do good to the nation. Take Apollo Plan as example, this expensive national plan which taking years of efforts and billions of money also seems unpromising when it was firstly introduced, if the governments at that times stop financing this unclear research, then today we might not be able to sit down before the computer to complete my GRE test.

In sum, the speaker's assertion that we should invest in research whose results are unclear <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">begs the question</mark>. Because firstly we cannot know whether research will turn out significant until we've invested it, secondly the finance form the taxpayers to support research do not expect immediate benefit outcomes, for the validation of the research takes years to test.
