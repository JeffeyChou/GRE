# Argument

按照题目的要求，一般可以分为以下4类：

assumption:
Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.


evidence:
Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.


explanation:
Write a response in which you discuss one or more alternative explanations that could rival the proposed explanation and explain how your explanation(s) can plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.


question:
Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide whether the recommendation is likely to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate the recommendation

> jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise. At present, the nearest jazz club is over 6o miles away from Monroe; thus, our proposed club, the C Note would have the local market all to itself. In addition there is ample evidence of the popularity of jazz in Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe's jazz festival last summer, several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe, and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly:' Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment. We therefore predict that the C Note cannot help but make money.

1. jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise.
2. At present, the nearest jazz club is over 6o miles away from Monroe; thus, our proposed club, *the C Note would have the local market all to itself.*
3. In addition there is ample evidence of the popularity of jazz in Monroe:
4. over 100,000 people *attended Monroe's jazz festival last summer*,
5. several *well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe*,
6. and the *highest-rated radio program* in Monroe is 'Jazz Nightly:'
7. Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment.
8. We therefore predict that the C Note cannot help but *make money*.

1. 这是作者的结论
**结论只能最后攻击，最好是按照文章逻辑推导顺序对推导过程逐个攻击（如果有），最后才是攻击它的结论**

> 只管作者的逻辑，作者提到的别人的逻辑跟作文内容无关，不需要攻击

2. [[条件错误]]：如果开了Club, C Note 就会占领市场
4. [[时间外推]]：去年受欢迎，以后也会受欢迎
5. [[因果错误]]：音乐家居住在M的原因不一定是因为这里jazz受欢迎。
6. [[因果错误]]/[[偷换概念]]：评分高 $\neq$ 受欢迎。可以是该时间段`Nightly`只有这个频道比较好；可以是受众比较少，恰巧都喜欢这个节目，给这个评分高
7. [[偷换概念]]：花钱在Jazz上 $\neq$ 花钱去Club
8. [[利润问题]]： Profitable $\neq$ make money。哪怕前面都对，也只能说明你的市场大，收入可能很高，但是相应的成本也会高，不一定就profitable

常见逻辑错误：

| 错误类型 | 表现形式                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 调查错误 | study, research, investigation           |
| 因果错误 | A cause B                                |
| 时间外推 | A will continue in the future            |
| 类比错误 | If A can succeed, then B can succeed too |
| 偷换概念 | A = B                                    |
| 利润问题 | Profit = Revenue - Cost                  |
| 条件错误 | If A, then B                             |
